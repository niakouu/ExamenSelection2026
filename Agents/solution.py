Robot Rescue Challenge - Solution Template

Implement your solution in the `solve` function below.
Your goal is to rescue the person trapped in the building as quickly as possible.

Available Robot methods:
    - robot.move(Direction) -> bool: Move in a direction (FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT, RIGHT)
    - robot.sense_fires_around() -> int: Get count of fires in adjacent cells (only cardinal directions, no diagonals) (does not cost time)
    - robot.scan_fires() -> Set[Position]: Get fire positions in cells around the robot (costs 10 seconds)
    - robot.position -> Position: Current robot position
    - robot.is_carrying_person -> bool: Whether robot is carrying someone
    - robot.get_grid_dimensions() -> Tuple[int, int]: Get (width, height)
    - robot.get_exit_position() -> Position: Get exit position
    - robot.get_person_position() -> Position: Get the person's position (known location)

Movement costs:
    - Each move: 1 second
    - Scan: 10 seconds

Rules:
    - There is exactly one person to rescue
    - The person's location is known from the start
    - Stepping on fire destroys the robot (mission fails immediately)
    - Robot starts at the exit position
    - Person is picked up automatically when robot reaches their cell
    - Mission ends automatically when robot returns to exit with the person

Objective: Navigate to the person, pick them up, and return to the exit as quickly as possible!

        The mission ends automatically when you return to the exit with the person.
